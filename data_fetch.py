data_fetch.py
-------------
Two jobs:

1. get_nifty500_list() - fetch the current Nifty500 constituent list from
   NSE's public archive CSV. NSE blocks requests without a browser-like
   User-Agent, so we set one. If the live fetch fails (NSE rate-limits /
   blocks a lot of cloud IPs), we fall back to a bundled CSV
   (data/nifty500_fallback.csv) so the app still works -- just flagged as
   possibly stale.

2. fetch_ohlcv() / fetch_batch() - pull OHLCV candles from Yahoo Finance
   via yfinance, in batches (Yahoo/yfinance will choke or rate-limit if
   you hit it with 500 individual single-ticker calls).

Note: Yahoo Finance data for NSE symbols is typically end-of-day accurate
but intraday candles can lag real-time by a few minutes and are not a
substitute for your broker/exchange terminal for actual execution.
